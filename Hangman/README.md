# About
This is an interactive Hangman game with a few extra features.
# Objective
The objective of this game is the same as traditional hangman. Users have the ability to choose different categories of words if they would like, or else choose random. The user has unlimited tries to guess the word. The program will let the user know if they guessed the same letter twice, and will prompt the user to guess a new letter. If the user gives up and wants to know the word, he/she can type 'answer' instead of guessing a letter and the game will end revealing the hidden word.
