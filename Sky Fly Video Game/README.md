# About
This is a graphical video game made using a library called Gamebox. This game implements many complex features such as screen movement, character hurdles, score count, timer, and character selection to name a few. 
# Objective
The objective of the game is to jump between moving blocks and stay alive as long as possible. Airplanes will randomly fly across the screen and if touched by the character, the health bar is decreased. The "devil" on the ground follows the character's moves and if touched, also results in a decrease in the healthbar.
