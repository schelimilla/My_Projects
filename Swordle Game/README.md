# About
This is an interactive game designed based off the popular game 'Wordle'. It utilizes the python library Turtle for graphic elements.

# Objective
The objective of this game is the same as Wordle, except that users guess six letter words. Users input 6 letter words, and the boxes turn yellow, green, or grey depending on whether the letter is present and in the right position as the secret word.
